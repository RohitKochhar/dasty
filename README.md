# Dasty: Declarative API Scenario Testing in YAML

<img src="./dasty.jpeg" alt="Dasty Logo" width="200"/>

Dasty is a Python package designed to simplify the process of testing APIs by allowing tests to be defined declaratively in YAML format. This approach makes API testing more accessible, maintainable, and efficient, especially for DevOps and full-stack development.

## Features

- **Declarative Syntax**: Define API tests in a simple, human-readable YAML format.
- **Benchmarking**: Measure performance metrics like response time and payload size.
- **Flexible Test Scenarios**: Support for various HTTP methods and validations.
- **Dynamic Variable Passing**: Extract values from responses for use in subsequent steps.

For a complete list of features, see [Detailed Features](docs/02_detailed_features.md).

## Quick Start

1. **Install Dasty**:
   ```bash
   pip install dasty_api
   ```

2. **Write Your API Test Scenario**:
   Create a YAML file defining your API tests. See [Getting Started](docs/01_getting_started.md) for examples.

3. **Run Your Scenario**:
   Use `ScenarioRunner` for standard testing or `Benchmarker` for performance benchmarking.

## Usage

For basic usage instructions and examples, refer to the [Getting Started](docs/01_getting_started.md) guide. For more advanced scenarios and detailed documentation, see [Detailed Features](docs/02_detailed_features.md.md).
